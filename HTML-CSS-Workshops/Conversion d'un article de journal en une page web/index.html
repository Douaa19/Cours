                When it comes to learning to code, one of the hardest parts can be finding the motivation to keep going when you feel stuck or frustrated. In fact, motivation is one of the most popular discussion topics in the Codecademy Facebook Community, as well as in the Codecademy forums.  
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                One community member, Brendan P., says, “I am having the hardest time staying motivated to learn. I feel like I am just failing left and right,” in a thread called How do you stay motivated?
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                In our Facebook community, Terrel J. says, “I have hit a roadblock and it’s mentally draining trying to learn how to code."

            <h2>7 tips for staying motivated while learning to code</h2>
            <p class="parag">If you’re having a hard time staying motivated while learning to code, know that you’re aren’t alone in feeling this way — we’ve all been there. And many of our community members have shared helpful tips based on their own experiences with finding motivation when they’re stuck or in a slump. We’ve compiled these tips into a list of seven ways to stay motivated and not give up.</p>
            <p class="parag">Here’s to finding your motivation!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="a1">
            <h3>Tip #1: Take the time to practice</h3>
            <p class="par">Many learners get stuck when they move too quickly through lessons without taking the time to practice. Spending time with a new concept is important so you can retain what you’ve learned and apply it as you move on to more advanced concepts.</p>
            <p class="par">In the “How do you stay motivated?” thread mentioned above, community member Jeff S. stresses the importance of practice. “Sometimes it takes a lot of practice with these more difficult concepts until you gain fluency.”</p>
            <p class="par">He equates learning to code to learning a language like Spanish or Italian. “It can be frustrating getting over the basics when all you want to do is communicate. That can be even more frustrating when you are surrounded by people who seem to speak Italian fluently.” But the more you speak, the more fluent you’ll become. The same holds true for learning to code — the more you practice, the more fluent you’ll become.</p>
            <p class="par">On a separate thread about learning to code, Shaylin also recommends practice. “I find it helpful to practice what you learn on your own. Make a small project that focuses on a single concept.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="a1">
            <h3>Tip #2: Look back at all you’ve accomplished</h3>
            <p class="par">When you get stuck, it can be easy to fixate on all that you still have to learn and to lose sight of everything you’ve already learned. The next time you’re feeling overwhelmed and down on yourself, take some time to reflect on how far you’ve come.</p>
            <p class="par">In his thread on motivation, Brendan P. says, “I guess I need to take a step back and look at what I’ve done. In 6 months my GitHub is full of programs that I wrote in half a dozen languages. I should use it as an example of my progress instead of how far I have left to go.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="a1">
            <h3>Tip #3: Remind yourself why you started learning to code</h3>
            <p class="par">A recent thread in our Facebook community dove into how to stay motivated during quarantine. Sunjay A. shared the following advice:</p>
            <div class="bor">   
                <p class="par">“In those days you feel without motivation, take a deep breath and find ways to rest. Next… try to remember the goal you had when you first began this journey. What motivated you then? If you had no specific goal, set one today and work toward that.”</p>
            </div> 
            <p class="par">Remembering why you started can be a nice way to rediscover what inspired you in the first place, reinvigorate your desire to learn, and help you find the motivation to keep going.</p>
            <p class="par">Paulina D. shares similar advice in the Codecademy forum. “Perhaps asking yourself what the skills you’re learning could help you achieve in the future would be a nice start. What would you like to do that would require those skills?”</p>
